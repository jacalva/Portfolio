# WEB PROJECT 2

Starfall Regime Enterprises is a prominent game industry publisher seeking to enhance its profitability by identifying and addressing underperforming development studios. To achieve this, they require the creation of a database system that tracks studio performance based on game sales. The goal is to pinpoint which studio is generating the weakest sales, enabling more targeted interventions to improve overall performance.

# Your task is to design and develop a webpage that can both display and categorize each development studio and its respective games. The system should allow the publisher to:

⦁	Add new games
⦁	Edit existing game details
⦁	Sort games based on various criteria (Title & Number of Copies sold)
⦁	Search for specific games by title 

# Additionally, the project should include an overview of the total number of copies sold for each studio, allowing the publisher to quickly assess overall studio performance.
